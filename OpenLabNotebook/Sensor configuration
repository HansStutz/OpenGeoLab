The inital sensor configuration was adjusted from the experimental set-up by DeJong et al. (2003). 

# Load cell
Both load cells for the measurement of the vertical and shear force are 5 kN S-shape load cells. Comparing different experimental data these
load cells have a maximum load which will be high enough. Further the S-shape configuration was chosen, because the acquisition tolerance is better
than with a flat load cell. 

# Linear potentiometers
The linear potentiometer were chosen with a length of 100mm because this distance is much more then the maximal travel way of the sled.
Two linear potentiometer were chosen to measure the horizontal sled deformation and average them on each side of the sled. 

# Top cap measurement 
The top cap measurement will be done over the increments from the step motor which apply the vertical force on top of the soil sample.
