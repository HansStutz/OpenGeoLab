The soil sample size will be: 100 mm x 60 mm x 25 mm 
The shear surface of the interface will be: 60 mm x 60 mm

The inital layout for the interface shear device is based on publications by DeJong and Westgate (2009) and Boukpeti and White (2016).
I have worked with the device described by DeJong (2009) during a lab-visit at UC Davis in July 2017. With respect to the handling and the 
ease of use, I have decided to use such an initial layout. However, I will try to improve the original layout with respect of the following 
points: 
- Improve the ease of use
- Improve the measurement system
- Enhance the measurement of the soil deformation using Particle image velocity
- Possible use of pore-pressure transducer at the interface

Based on this a lot of small modifications to the original device are made.
