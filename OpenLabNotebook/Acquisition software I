The acquisition and control software that have to be developed for the Open Science Interface shear device will be done with LabView. 
LabView is a graphical programming system from National instruments. 

After the arrival of the load cells I have integrated in a first draft of a control software. The control software will be programmed with the following parts: 
1. Initial set-up
2. Consolidation 
3. Shear test -> Constant normal load or stiffness conditions

During the test the data must be recorded and also plotted in real time in the program. This is the rough layout for the software development.
